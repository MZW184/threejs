        <h1>Lets Dive into My Self-Taught Web Development Journey</h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>
          In April 2023, I embarked on a self-taught journey into web
          development. Armed with determination <br />
          ​and a thirst for knowledge,
          <br />
          I dove headfirst into the vast ocean of code. Here’s how my path
          unfolded: <br />
          <br />

          HTML, CSS, and JS Beginnings: <br />
          <br />
          I started with the basics: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Creating simple
          frontend websites <br />
          felt like ​a breeze initially, but as time passed, the challenges
          grew. <br />
          Udemy, short free courses, Google, ​and YouTube became my companions
          though, in hindsight, maybe <br />
          not the ideal ones for diving ​into web development. <br />
          Despite feeling a bit lost, I refused to give up. I stumbled through
          the learning process, often ​feeling <br />
          like I was wearing a blindfold.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="section-two">
        <h1>React and ​Terminal ​Adventures:</h1>
        <p>
          React soon caught my attention, and I explored the world of npm
          packages. <br />
          The sudden shift in ​programming languages left me feeling
          disoriented, but I refused to give up. <br />
          Even with a metaphorical blindfold on, I persisted. <br />
          I sought mentorships and learnerships to ​accelerate my progress,
          determined to conquer the challenges of <br />
          programming, but i was’nt able to ​find any form of support.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-three">
        <h1>Expanding ​Horizons:</h1>
        <p>
          To broaden my skill set, I enrolled in a short computer science
          course. There, I grappled with <br />
          C and ​Python, yet I still didn’t feel entirely comfortable as a
          developer. <br />
          I explored game development. Unity and Blender caught my eye, but it
          was <br />
          Unreal Engine that truly sparked my creativity. <br />
          C++ blueprints led me to build basic games ,a thrilling experience.
          <br />
          Still, I grappled with self-doubt. Was I truly a developer? ​Where was
          my creativity <br />
          hiding? Tutors remained elusive, <br />
          but my determination held ​strong. I wanted to be exceptional, so I
          kept pushing ​forward.
        </p>

      <div class="section-four">
        <h1>Finding ​Direction with ​SheCodes:</h1>
        <p>
          Recently, I received a reminder from SheCodes about starting my <br />
          journey with them in August 2024. ​From scratch, I’ve <br />
          immersed myself in their program. <br />
          <br />
          For the first time, I don’t feel like I’m stumbling <br />
          blindly; I have a clear direction. SheCodes encourages me to push
          <br />
          my limits, solving problems independently before seeking help. <br />
          It’s not that I dislike asking for assistance; rather, <br />
          I want to cultivate resilience and self-reliance. <br />
          My ultimate goal is to become an exceptional programmer. <br />
          I ​intend to continue learning, growing gradually, <br />
          and ​contributing meaningfully to projects. <br />
          I believe that by ​persistently tackling challenges, <br />
          I’ll inch closer to that ​goal—one line of code at a time.
